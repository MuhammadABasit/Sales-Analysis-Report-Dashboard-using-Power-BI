## Disclaimer: This work is solely for practice and learning purposes. I watched 'Ali Ahmad's' youtube video on creating a Data Analyst Portfolio.

Doing this Practice project gave me the ability to learn SQL and PowerBI to enhance my Data Analysis skills. The technoligies I used were PowerBI, Microsoft SQL Server Management System, Excel and wordpress to create the website and show off my portfolio. The link for the website is below:

Along with that, I was able to pubish my PowerBI Dashboard of my Sales Analysis:
